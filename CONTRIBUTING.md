# Contributing to the PredictionIO Ruby SDK

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the PredictionIO Ruby SDK Simplified!

We are building this software together and strongly encourage contributions
from the community that are within the guidelines set forth below.

## Environment

We highly suggest using [RVM](https://rvm.io/) or [rbenv]
(https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) to set up Ruby development and
testing environments. In this way, moving between and testing code for
alternate Ruby versions (besides the one possibly included with your
system) is simple. This practice is essential for ensuring the quality
of the SDK.

## Pull Requests

The SDK follows the [git-flow]
(http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) model where all
active development goes to the develop branch, and releases go to the master
branch. Pull requests should be made against the develop branch and include
relevant tests, if applicable.
